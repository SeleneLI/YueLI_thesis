The \emph{\acrfull{lisp}} is proposed in 2006 to initially address nowadays' Internet scalability issues, since it 

but also brings some other benefits to the future Internet. Although \acrshort{lisp} is currently under standardization in IETF and is deployed in the wild by two testbeds at the same time, it is still immature. \acrshort{lisp} lacks the thorough and detailed measurement works to show its performance in the large-scale realistic networks and improve itself. In this dissertation, we assess \acrshort{lisp} from the different aspectsÂ :
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item \emph{\acrfull{eid}} and
	\item \emph{\acrfull{rloc}}.
\end{inparaenum}
