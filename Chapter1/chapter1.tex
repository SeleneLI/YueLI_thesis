Since the \acrshort{arpanet} (\acrlong{arpanet}) emerged in 1966~\cite{marill1966toward}, the Internet has obtained significant achievements over the last fifty years and developed very fast. Until the beginning of 2018, the Internet users in the world achieves 3.82 billions, i.e., around 40\% of the world population has an Internet connection today~\cite{InternetLiveStats}. Moreover, we come into an era of the mobile Internet. According to the latest research~\cite{SmartInsights}, the number of global mobile users has been higher than that of desktop since 2014. Although having a huge success, today's Internet is suffering the overloading of IP address semantics, which results in many shortcomings in the application landscape~\cite{feng2017locator}. As in the current TCP/IP protocol stack, the IP address serves both \emph{who} to identify the host and \emph{where} to indicate the attachment point in the network topology, it leads to a serious routing scalability problem. As shown in Fig.~\ref{Growth_BGP_Table}, the BGP table size, which is the number of IP prefixes in the \acrshort{bgp} (\acrlong{bgp}) routing table of \acrshort{dfz} (\acrlong{dfz}) routers, has grown at a super-linear rate in recent years. After full use of IPv6, the routing scalability issue will be aggravated, since it has much larger addressing space than IPv4. Maintaining such routing table is very cumbersome. Particular, once a site changes its routing information, all the corresponding routers need to update, which causes a huge BGP churn. In addition, frequent routing information updates result in the increasing of convergence time and packet loss rates.

To cope with the current Internet scalability problems, the Loc/ID Split Networking is proposed, which separates the single IP addressing space into two roles: \emph{who} and \emph{where}. Many solutions based on this mechanism are proposed, which can be classified into two catalogs: \emph{Host-based} and \emph{Network-based}. The former one needs modify the host stack. The representative architectures are: HIP (Host Identity Protocol)~\cite{nikander2010host}~\cite{Moskowitz2017host}~\cite{moskowitz2015host}, Six/One~\cite{vogt2007six}, SHIM6 (Site Multihoming by IPv6 Intermediation)~\cite{garcia2010shim6}~\cite{nordmark2009shim6}, ILNP (Identifier-Locator Network Protocol)~\cite{bhatti2012identifier}~\cite{atkinson2010evolving}, and LNA (Layered Naming Architecture)~\cite{balakrishnan2004layered}. The later one needs to update the routers, and the representative proposals are: GSE (Global, Site, and End-system address elements)~\cite{o2006gse}, LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol)~\cite{rfc6830}, and TIDR (Tunneled Inter-domain Routing)~\cite{adan2006tunneled}. Among them, LISP is outstanding by its relatively comprehensive network systems in both control and data planes. This characterization promotes the standardization, production and industrtialization of LISP. It was initially proposed by Cisco in 2006 and has an exclusive IETF WG since 2009, which guarantees LISP can be actively under developed.

The key philosophy of LISP is to separate the IP addressing space into two sub-spaces: the \emph{Routing LOCators} (RLOCs) and the \emph{Endpoint IDentifiers} (EIDs). End-to-end communication is based on EIDs, which in an intra-domain context means just to performing conventional routing and forwarding. On the contrary, for inter-domain end-to-end communication, RLOCs are used for routing and forwarding. To this end, LISP does a map-and-encap operation, first mapping EIDs to RLOCs (through a DNS-like on-demand mapping system~\cite{lispALTPourri}, where \acrfull{mr} is used to receive the query) and then encapsulating the original packet so to use RLOCs on the outer header. Internetworking between LISP and non-LISP networks is performed through two types of proxies~\cite{rfc6832}: \emph{Proxy Ingress Tunnel Routers} (PITRs) and \emph{Proxy Egress Tunnel Routers} (PETRs). They are collectively denoted by \emph{PxTR}. PITRs advertise in the BGP  routing infrastructure the EID-prefix space on behalf of the LISP sites, so that non-LISP sites can reach them. In this way PITRs attract the traffic from non-LISP sites, which simply send packets with destination EID as destination IP address. Subsequently the PITR performs LISP encapsulation and forward the packets to the destination. PETRs are used as exit points from LISP sites when the destination is not an EID in a LISP site. Hence, PETRs decapsulate the LISP-encapsualted packets received from LISP-sites and forwards them in the legacy Internet. With help of this detaching mechanism, LISP is able to improve the Internet routing scalability, enable enhanced inter-domain traffic engineering, lightweight multi-tenant carrier-grade VPN, and \acrshort{vm}s mobility in Data-Centers~\cite{saucez2012designing}.

% LISP introduces several benefits to the Internet architecture. Many companies and academic institutes participate into LISP development, so that the standardizations and research publications about LISP are continuously came out in the recent years. Besides, two large scale experimental LISP platforms are deployed on the world respectively in 2008 and 2015. All the efforts, however, are mainly about the description of LISP architectures, implementations, extensions and applications. It lacks of the comprehensive LISP measurement works from the various aspects. In addition, LISP remains a relatively recent technology and these large scale flexible platforms are still in an early stage, it needs plenty of large scale experiments to obtain realistic LISP experiences ont only further improve the performance of two platforms, but ultimately to provide feedback to the community on how to move the LISP technology forward.

As LISP is a promising technology that brings many benefits to the future Internet, it attracts the attention from both academic and industrial world. Many companies, universities and research institutes are now involved in the development of LISP. Hence, the related standardization and researches are very active. In terms of deployment, two large-scale experimental LISP platforms: LISP Beta Network and LISP-Lab platform are deployed on the world respectively in 2008 and 2015. Up to date, all the efforts are mainly about the theoretic performance analysis, description of LISP architectures, implementations, extensions, applications and so on. However, it lacks of the comprehensive measurement works for LISP technology itself. These performance measurements work will give the research community a clear view about the LISP performance, reveal the points that can be improved, indicate possible research directions, and improve the performance of two platforms. Thus, the large-scale measurements in realistic networks are of paramount importance for the LISP development.

\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:intro_contributions}
With the goal of evaluating LISP from the different views, in this dissertation we aim at answering the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
	\item Mapping system is essential in LISP, because it decides where the packets will be routed. Thus, does it always provide the identical mapping information for the same destination? Does every \acrshort{mr} offer the same response at the same time? Does the mapping information replies keep consistent if we query them from the different \acrfull{vp}s?
	
	We continuously measured LISP Beta Network for seventeen days. Measurements show that the LISP mapping system is stable over most of time. The replies from the different \acrshort{mr}s and \acrshort{vp}s are also mostly consistent. Nevertheless, instability and inconsistency are observed although they are rare events. We define a new taxonomy to classify these instability and inconsistency so to facilitate the deeper analysis. This work is published in WNM~\cite{yue2016stability}.
	
	\item As the results of the last question show that there exists inconsistency between the \acrshort{mr}s and \acrshort{vp}s, is it possible to implement a more comprehensive monitor than today's LISPmon so to simultaneously supervise all the \acrshort{mr}s as experimenter define instead of just supervising one \acrshort{mr}?
	
	We propose a dynamic LISP monitoring architecture, namely LISP-Views, so to deepen the understandings on LISP and to ease day-to-day operations and troubleshooting. After one full month monitoring to the whole LISP mapping system of two platforms, it demonstrates that LISP-Views provides more information by discovering more mapping information from all \acrshort{mr}s and more complete mapping information of each \acrshort{mr}. Furthermore, with our proposed monitoring platform, more mapping system performance metrics such as reliability, latency, and configuration issues can be assessed, which helps for further LISP improvements. This work is published in ITC~\cite{li2017lisp}.
	
	\item By using proxy approach to communicate with the legacy Internet, a stretch in the path is introduced. Thus, how much is it in the real world performance when the platforms integrate with the legacy Internet? Under which conditions such stretch has an important impact on the performance? Conversely, under which situation such overhead is so small that it can be ignored? 
	
	To evaluate LISP interworking performance with legacy Internet, we conduct two times experiments. The results of twice experiments are coherent. Both of them show that LISP is stable although the stretch is introduced due to the introducing of proxy. We find that the proxy indeed introduces the negative effects for the destinations located in Europe and America, but can be ignored for the intercontinental long-distance transmission to Asia destinations. Besides, we observe that the position of proxy is very important. It either near to the sources or the destinations can decrease the latency a lot. Further, the performance of LISP-Lab PxTR is more reliable than the one of LISP Beta Network. This work is published in INFOCOM WKSHPS~\cite{li2016using}, SIGCOMM~\cite{li2016performance}, and Computer Networks~\cite{Li2017}.
